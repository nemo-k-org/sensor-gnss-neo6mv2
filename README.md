# Nemo-K location (GNSS) sensor for NEO 6M breakout board GY-NEO6MV2 

## Overview

This is Nemo-K board for ESP-01 and NEO 6M GNSS breakout board typically labelled
as `GY-NEO6MV2`. The board is widely available in stores selling Arduino-IoT related stuff.

The board sends GNSS information to Signal K server.

The board is designed to be used with ESP-01 microcontroller running Nemo-K firmware.

## Content

The repository contains schematics and PCB in KiCad 8.0 format. The footprint properties contains LCSC part numbers
used by [JLCPBC.com](https://jlcpcb.com). If present, the `sensor-gnssneo6mv2/production/` contains all necessary
files to order boards from JLCPCB. The production files can be easily re-created using
[KiCad Fabrication Toolkit](https://github.com/bennymeg/Fabrication-Toolkit).

The Nemo-K project is not affiliated or sponsored by JLCPCB. The project does not endorse JLCPCB.
